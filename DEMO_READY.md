# 🎉 Demo Ready!

## ✅ What's Done

### 1. Enhanced Schema
- ✅ Added `agent_questions` table (tracks investigations)
- ✅ Updated `agent_events` with `question_id` and `step_order`
- ✅ Full question lifecycle tracking

### 2. Realistic Seed Data
- ✅ 5 products (Premium Wireless Headphones is the problem product)
- ✅ ~140 orders over 14 days showing clear sales collapse
- ✅ 44 feedback entries (35 negative, 9 positive)
- ✅ Mix of direct mentions + semantic variations
- ✅ Customer lifetime value data

### 3. Embeddings
- ✅ All 44 feedback entries have vector embeddings
- ✅ Ready for semantic search with pgvectorscale

### 4. Database Features Enabled
- ✅ TimescaleDB hypertables (`agent_events`)
- ✅ pgvectorscale DiskANN indexes
- ✅ PostgreSQL full-text search indexes
- ✅ Question tracking for observability

## 📊 Demo Data Summary

### Sales Pattern
```
Premium Wireless Headphones:
- 14 days ago: $2,400/day (best seller!)
- 7 days ago: $2,100/day (still strong)
- 4 days ago: $600/day (dropping!)
- 2 days ago: $300/day (collapsed)
- Yesterday: $300/day (nearly dead)
```

### Feedback Breakdown
```
Total: 44 feedback entries

Negative (35):
├─ Product X (Premium Wireless Headphones): 27
│  ├─ Direct mentions: 7 ("Premium Wireless Headphones broken")
│  └─ Semantic variations: 20 ("expensive headphones", "$299", "flagship audio")
│
├─ Product Y (Smart Fitness Watch): 8
│  └─ Emerging pattern (started 4 days ago)
│
Positive (9):
└─ Other products working fine (Bluetooth Speaker, Laptop Stand, USB-C Cable)
```

### Business Impact
```
Complaining Customers: 35
Average Lifetime Value: $597.12
Total Value at Risk: $20,899.28
```

## 🎬 Demo Flow (Ready to Execute!)

### Q1: The Problem
```bash
npm run dev "Sales dropped yesterday compared to last week - why?"
```
**Expected**: Agent finds Premium Wireless Headphones revenue collapsed from $2K+/day to $300/day

**Shows**: 
- ✨ Multi-step agentic investigation
- ✨ SQL analytics
- ✨ Pattern detection

---

### Q2: The Customer Voice
```bash
npm run dev "What are customers saying about Product X?"
```
*Note: Once we implement hybrid search tool*

**Expected**: Finds 27 complaints using hybrid search (direct + semantic)

**Shows**:
- ✨ Hybrid search (FTS + Vector)
- ✨ pgvectorscale DiskANN index
- ✨ Semantic understanding
- ✨ Finds "expensive headphones", "flagship audio" → Product X

---

### Q3: Pattern Recognition
```bash
npm run dev "Are other products having similar problems?"
```
*Note: Once we implement semantic search across products*

**Expected**: Finds Product Y showing same pattern (8 complaints starting 4 days ago)

**Shows**:
- ✨ Semantic search across dataset
- ✨ Cross-product correlation
- ✨ Pattern detection

---

### Q4: Business Impact
```bash
npm run dev "Which customers are we losing? Should I be worried?"
```

**Expected**: 35 high-value customers ($21K total value at risk), many stopped buying

**Shows**:
- ✨ Complex SQL with CTEs
- ✨ Customer lifetime value
- ✨ Behavior analysis

---

### Q5: The Decision
```bash
npm run dev "What should I do about Product X?"
```

**Expected**: Agent synthesizes all findings, provides action plan

**Shows**:
- ✨ Memory retrieval (`search_insights`)
- ✨ Cross-investigation synthesis
- ✨ Actionable recommendations

---

### Q6: The Reveal
```bash
npm run dev "How did you figure all this out?"
```

**Expected**: Agent explains it used ONE database with multiple capabilities

**Shows**:
- ✨ Self-observability (`analyze_agent_performance`)
- ✨ TimescaleDB hypertable query
- ✨ THE BIG REVEAL

---

## 🛠️ What's Next

### To Complete The Demo, We Need To:

1. **Add Tools** (currently only has `query_database`):
   - [ ] `hybrid_search` - Combine FTS + semantic search
   - [ ] `semantic_search_feedback` - Vector similarity search  
   - [ ] `fulltext_search` - PostgreSQL FTS
   - [ ] `store_insight` - Save learnings with embeddings
   - [ ] `search_insights` - Search agent memory
   - [ ] `analyze_agent_performance` - Query agent_events

2. **Update Agent System Prompt**:
   - [ ] Add instructions for when to use each tool
   - [ ] Add hybrid search examples
   - [ ] Add semantic search guidance

3. **Test Full Flow**:
   - [ ] Run all 6 questions
   - [ ] Verify each tool is used appropriately
   - [ ] Confirm narrative flows smoothly

## 🚀 Quick Test

Right now, you can test Q1 with the current agent:

```bash
npm run dev "Sales dropped yesterday compared to last week - why?"
```

The agent will investigate using multiple SQL queries and find that Premium Wireless Headphones sales collapsed!
