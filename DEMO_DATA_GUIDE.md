## Demo Query Examples

### Q1: Sales Analysis
```sql
-- Show sales drop
SELECT 
  order_date,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE product_name = 'Premium Wireless Headphones') as orders,
  SUM(amount) FILTER (WHERE product_name = 'Premium Wireless Headphones') as revenue
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - 14
GROUP BY order_date

FROM user_feedback
WHERE sentiment = 'negative'
  AND product_referenced IN ('Premium Wireless Headphones', 'Smart Fitness Watch')
GROUP BY product_referenced;
```

```sql
-- Customers who complained + their total purchases
WITH complaining_customers AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT customer_id

  WHERE sentiment = 'negative'
    AND created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - 7
)
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) as affected_customers,

  AVG(orders_per_customer) as avg_orders_each
FROM orders o
JOIN complaining_customers cc ON o.customer_id = cc.customer_id
GROUP BY o.customer_id;
```
