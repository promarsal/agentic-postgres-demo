**📝 Note**: When called for the *current* question, there are no steps yet. To demo properly, could query a *specific previous* question ID.

**💡 Demo Enhancement**: Pass a previous question ID to show full analytics:
```typescript
// In the tool, could accept questionId from previous investigation
await db.analyzeAgentPerformance(previousQuestionId);
```

## 🎤 Key Demo Moments Verified

### 🌟 Moment 1: Semantic Matches (Q2)
**What Happened**: Agent found "flagship wireless headphones" and "expensive headphones" when searching for "Premium Wireless Headphones"

**Demo Script**:
> "See this feedback that says 'flagship wireless headphones'? That's NOT the exact product name! Vector search found it because it understands MEANING, not just keywords. This would cost you $70/month on Pinecone. We're doing it in PostgreSQL."

---

### 🌟 Moment 2: Hybrid Search Power (Q2)
**What Happened**: 15 comprehensive results combining FTS (10) + vector search

**Demo Script**:
> "Hybrid search combines keyword precision with semantic understanding. You get the best of Elasticsearch AND Pinecone in ONE query. No data syncing, no complexity."

---

### 🌟 Moment 3: Pattern Recognition (Q3)
**What Happened**: Agent predicted Smart Fitness Watch issues before they escalated

**Demo Script**:
> "The agent didn't just answer - it DISCOVERED a pattern. Smart Fitness Watch has 8 complaints - an emerging issue! Early warning system powered by semantic search."

---

### 🌟 Moment 4: Unified Database (Q4)
**What Happened**: Single query joined structured orders with unstructured feedback

**Demo Script**:
> "Watch this - structured data (orders) joined with unstructured data (feedback) in ONE query. No ETL, no data pipelines. Just PostgreSQL."

---

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: FTS Query Syntax Error ✅ FIXED
**Error**: "syntax error in tsquery: 'Premium Wireless Headphones'"
**Cause**: Spaces in product names not converted to `&` operator
**Fix**: Added `.split(/\s+/).join(' & ')` to format keywords
**Status**: ✅ Resolved and working

### Issue 2: Nested Aggregate Functions ✅ FIXED
**Error**: "aggregate function calls cannot be nested"
**Cause**: `COUNT(*)` inside `jsonb_object_agg()` in Q6
**Fix**: Split into two separate queries - main stats + tool usage
**Status**: ✅ Resolved and working

### Issue 3: Column Name Errors (Self-Corrected)
**Error**: Agent queried non-existent column `product_name`
**Cause**: Schema uses `product_referenced` in user_feedback
**Fix**: Agent self-corrected automatically ✅
**Status**: ✅ Demonstrates resilience

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Better Q5 (Agent Memory) Demo:

**Current**: No insights stored, so search returns empty

**Enhancement**: Modify system prompt to encourage storing insights:

```typescript
system: `...
After completing an investigation, ALWAYS use store_insight to save key findings.
Example: "store_insight('Premium Wireless Headphones have quality issues causing sales drop')"
...`
```

**Alternative**: Pre-seed agent_memory with sample insights during setup

---

### For Better Q6 (Meta-Analysis) Demo:

**Current**: Analyzes current question (no steps yet)

**Enhancement Option 1**: Modify the question to reference previous:
```bash
npm run dev "Analyze how you investigated the headphones issue in your previous question"
```

**Enhancement Option 2**: Have agent retrieve most recent completed question:
```typescript
// In analyze_agent_performance tool
const lastQuestion = await sql`
  SELECT id FROM agent_questions 
  WHERE status = 'completed' 
  ORDER BY completed_at DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
`;
// Analyze that question
```
