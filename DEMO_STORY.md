# üéØ TigerData Demo Story: The Online Store Mystery

This demo tells a story where one question leads to another, showcasing how different TigerData/Timescale technologies work together to solve real business problems.

## üìñ The Story

Your online store's flagship product (Premium Wireless Headphones) suddenly stopped selling. As a data detective, you'll investigate using SQL analytics, semantic search, and AI-powered insights to uncover what happened and what to do about it.

## üé¨ Demo Script

Run these questions in order to tell the complete story:

### Q1: SQL Analytics üìä
**Question:** "Sales dropped yesterday compared to last week - why?"

**Technologies Showcased:**
- ‚úÖ **PostgreSQL** - Complex SQL queries with CASE statements
- ‚úÖ **TimescaleDB** - Time-series comparisons (day-over-day, week-over-week)
- ‚úÖ **SQL Analytics** - Product-level breakdown with GROUP BY

**What it finds:**
- Premium Wireless Headphones: $0 yesterday vs $2,099 last week (-$2,099 drop!)
- Smart Fitness Watch: Also dropped to $0
- Other products relatively stable

**Key Insight:** Two products completely stopped selling!

```bash
npm run dev "Sales dropped yesterday compared to last week - why?"
```

### Q2: Hybrid Search üîç‚ú®
**Question:** "What are customers saying about Premium Wireless Headphones?"

**Technologies Showcased:**
- ‚úÖ **pgvector** - Semantic vector similarity search
- ‚úÖ **PostgreSQL FTS** - Full-text search with ranking
- ‚úÖ **Hybrid Search** - RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) combining both
- ‚úÖ **pgvectorscale** - DiskANN index for fast vector search

**What it finds:**
- 15 customer complaints found
- 14 matches from BOTH semantic AND keyword search
- 1 semantic-only match (found "flagship wireless headphones" = Premium Wireless Headphones)
- Quality issues: damaged out of box, defective units, poor materials

**Key Insight:** Widespread quality control failures causing customer dissatisfaction!

```bash
npm run dev "What are customers saying about Premium Wireless Headphones?"
```

### Q3: Semantic Search üß†
**Question:** "Are other products showing similar quality issues?"

**Technologies Showcased:**
- ‚úÖ **pgvector** - Semantic similarity finds conceptually related issues
- ‚úÖ **Vector embeddings** - Understands meaning, not just keywords
- ‚úÖ **SQL + Vectors** - Combines vector search with structured data

**What it finds:**

- These are high-risk customers likely to churn
- Need immediate outreach for retention

**Key Insight:** Identified specific at-risk customers requiring immediate action!

```bash
npm run dev "Which customers bought Premium Wireless Headphones and left negative feedback?"
```

---

### Q5: Agent Memory üß†üíæ
**Question:** "Based on what we've learned, what should I do immediately?"

**Technologies Showcased:**
- ‚úÖ **Agent Memory** - Recalls insights from previous investigations
- ‚úÖ **Vector Search on Insights** - Semantic search across learnings
- ‚úÖ **Learning Across Sessions** - Builds on past findings
- ‚úÖ **Synthesis** - Combines multiple findings into actionable recommendations

**What it finds:**
- Recalls: Sales dropped $12,958 ‚Üí $1,729 (86% decline!)
- Recalls: Quality issues across Premium Wireless Headphones
- Synthesizes: 4 immediate action items with priorities

**Key Recommendations:**
1. Address quality issues - recall or QA measures
2. Contact 27 at-risk customers - refunds/replacements
3. Monitor sales trends daily
4. Review product listings and quality messaging

**Key Insight:** Agent learns and builds knowledge across investigations!

```bash
npm run dev "Based on what we've learned, what should I do immediately?"
```

---

### Q6: Meta-Analysis üî¨
**Question:** "Show me how you figured out the sales drop - what was your investigation process?"

**Technologies Showcased:**
- ‚úÖ **TimescaleDB Hypertable** - Stores all agent events as time-series data
- ‚úÖ **Self-Observability** - Agent queries its own investigation history
- ‚úÖ **Process Mining** - Analyzes tools used, duration, success/failure
- ‚úÖ **Meta-Learning** - Understands how it solves problems

**What it shows:**
- Investigation steps breakdown
- Tools used: query_database, hybrid_search, semantic_search, etc.
- Duration and performance metrics
- Success/error analysis

**Key Insight:** Full transparency into AI decision-making process!

```bash
npm run dev "Show me how you figured out the sales drop - what was your investigation process?"
```

---

## üîß Technical Details

### Database Schema:
- `orders` - Sales transactions (time-series)
- `products` - Product catalog
- `user_feedback` - Customer feedback with embeddings
- `agent_questions` - Investigation tracking
- `agent_events` - Hypertable for agent actions (TimescaleDB)
- `agent_memory` - Agent insights with vectors

### Key SQL Patterns:
```sql
-- Time-series comparison with CASE
SELECT product_name,
  SUM(CASE WHEN order_date = CURRENT_DATE-1 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as yesterday,
  SUM(CASE WHEN order_date = CURRENT_DATE-8 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as last_week
FROM orders
GROUP BY product_name;

-- Hybrid search with RRF
WITH semantic AS (...),
     fulltext AS (...)
SELECT *,
  (1.0/(semantic.rank+60) + 1.0/(fulltext.rank+60)) as rrf_score
FROM semantic FULL OUTER JOIN fulltext
ORDER BY rrf_score DESC;

-- Vector similarity
SELECT *,
  1 - (embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity
FROM user_feedback
ORDER BY similarity DESC;
```

---

## üìù Notes

- All embeddings are generated using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small
- Hybrid search uses websearch_to_tsquery for natural language queries
- Agent events stored in TimescaleDB hypertable with time_bucket() support
- DiskANN index on vectors for sub-millisecond similarity search
